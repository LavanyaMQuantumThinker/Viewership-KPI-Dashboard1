Analyzing the Viewership of Behindwoods Youtube Channel in different aspects

# 🎬 YouTube Viewership Performance Dashboard

## 🎯 Why I Built This

In the heart of the digital age, where media companies like **Behindwoods** publish hundreds of videos monthly, I wondered:

> *"What if I could build a dashboard that speaks their language — a platform that doesn't just count views but tells stories through data?"*

As a data enthusiast with a love for cinema, I merged two worlds:  
📽️ *Content* and 📊 *Insights*

## 📚 The Story Behind the Dashboard

This project simulates a **real-world media analyst tool**, designed for use in content studios, production houses, or marketing teams.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Step 1**: I used YouTube Data API to fetch real-time stats for videos from a channel like `BehindwoodsTV`
2. **Step 2**: I processed the data to extract:
   - Views, Likes, Comments
   - Engagement Rate
   - Post Frequency (how often videos are uploaded)
3. **Step 3**: I visualized it in a custom-built, Python-powered **Streamlit dashboard**.

All using:
- 📦 `pandas` for data wrangling
- 📊 `matplotlib` for quick insights
- 🌐 `streamlit` to make it interactive and user-friendly
